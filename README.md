# In The Loop
An extension that improves the School Loop interface by letting users calculate what their grades would be after the teacher updates grades, allowing users to change the appearance of their School Loop page, and notifying users when their grades change.  

## Installation
In The Loop is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/in-the-loop-for-school-lo/ppigcngidmooiiafkelbilbojiijffag).
Note: This extension only works for number grades (not for letter grades like "A") for now

## Privacy
-  All data is stored locally on the user's computer. No data about the user is collected or sent anywhere.
-  The username & password information, if entered by the user, is encrypted and stored locally.
-  Data stored (only if the user voluntarily allows and enters it): school subdomain (i.e. "lynbrook", "montavista", etc), username, password, overall grade percentages for each class (used for notifications), and theme selection/customization options

Its source code is available at https://github.com/mash99/InTheLoop.

1.  Make it work for letter grades!
2.  Assignment features
